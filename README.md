# Tic-Tac-Toe using PYNQ-Z2

## Overview
This project implements a Tic-Tac-Toe game using the PYNQ-Z2 board. Players can interact with the game using buttons and LEDs available on the board. Additionally, a hardware design using a breadboard and external LEDs is implemented to create a grid-like system with different LEDs assigned to two different colors for each player.

## Requirements
- PYNQ-Z2 development board
- Vivado Design Suite (for FPGA development)
- Breadboard and external LEDs
- Wires and resistors for connections
