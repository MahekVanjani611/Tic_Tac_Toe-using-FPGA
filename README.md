# Tic-Tac-Toe using PYNQ-Z2

## Overview
This project implements a Tic-Tac-Toe game using the PYNQ-Z2 board. Players can interact with the game using buttons and LEDs available on the board. Additionally, a hardware design using a breadboard and external LEDs is implemented to create a grid-like system with different LEDs assigned to two different colors for each player.

## Requirements
- PYNQ-Z2 development board
- Vivado Design Suite (for FPGA development)
- Breadboard and external LEDs
- Wires and resistors for connections

## Hardware Setup:
Connect the external LEDs to the breadboard.
Assign different colors to the LEDs to represent each player.
Connect the LEDs and buttons to the PYNQ-Z2 board using wires and resistors as needed.
Ensure that each LED is correctly connected to the corresponding output pins on the PYNQ-Z2 board.

## Run the Game:
Program the PYNQ-Z2 board with the generated bitstream using Vivado.
Follow the instructions displayed on the LEDs to interact with the game using the connected buttons.
